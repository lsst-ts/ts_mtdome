    Parameters
    ----------
    **params:

    -------
        An encoded string representation of the string and parameters.

    Parameters

    -------
        A decoded Python representation of the string.

    There are eight schemas: one for the commands, one for each of six status
    command responses and one for all other command responses. This function
    determines which schema to use based on the keys in the data. Commands are
    validated as well to ensure that the simulator receives correct commands
    and this should be done by other clients too.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data: `dict`
        The data to validate. The format of the dict is explained in the
        `encode` function.

    Raises
    ------
    ValidationError:
        In case the validation fails.
    ValueError:
        In case the retrieved data doesn't contain a known key.
